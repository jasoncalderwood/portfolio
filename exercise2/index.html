 Do you feel it in your stomach?
  Does it twist and turn and scream and burn
   And start to make you cry, but you like it?
    Don't want to let it slip away
     Does it stretch into your throat
      Until you don’t know what to say?
       Does it hold you under its pillow in the night?
        It kills you with its passion
         And its endless beam of light
          When you see yourself
           In the future, frail and gray
            Who do you want beside you
             When you wake to start your day?
               Yeah, it's extreme
              I know what you're gonna say
             I’m being too dramatic
            But this feeling feels this way
           Are you in love?
          Do you feel it in your spine?
         Shaking, waking, tearing, <a href="var2.html">breaking</a>
        Taking its sweet time
       But you want it
      Yeah, you need it just to breathe
     You're never sure of what trick
    It's pulling from its sleeve
   If you said yes
  To all the things above
 Then yes, my friend, I'm sorry
It appears you are in love
