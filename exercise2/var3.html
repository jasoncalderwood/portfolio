<p>Are you in love?</p>
<p>Do you feel it in your stomach?</p>
<p>Does it twist and turn and scream and burn</p>
<p>And start to make you cry, but you like it?</p>
<p>Don't want to let it slip away</p>
<p>Does it stretch into your throat</p>
<p>Until you don’t know what to say?</p></div>
<div class="second"><p>Does it hold you under its pillow in the night?</p>
<p>It kills you with its passion</p>
<p>And its endless beam of light</p>
<p>When you see yourself</p>
<p>In the future, frail and gray</p>
<p>Who do you want beside you</p>
<p>When you wake to start your day?</p></div>
<div class="third"><p>Yeah, it's extreme</p>
<p>I know what you're gonna say</p>
<p>I’m being too dramatic</p>
<p>But this feeling feels this way</p>
<p>Are you in love?</p>
<p>Do you feel it in your spine?</p>
<p>Shaking, waking, tearing, breaking</p>
<p>Taking its sweet time</p></div>
<div class="fourth"><p>But you want it</p>
<p>Yeah, you need it just to breathe</p>
<p>You're never sure of what trick</p>
<p>It's pulling from its sleeve</p>
<p>If you said yes</p>
<p>To all the things above</p>
<p>Then yes, my friend, I'm sorry</p></div>
<div class="kicker"><p><a href="var4.html">It appears you are in love</a></p></div>
