    <h2>First Week (Syllabus week doesn't count)</h2>
    <hr></hr>
    <p>As things start slow, I don't really have much to write about right now. I will say that before going over them on Friday, I was concerned that bold and italics counted as CSS styling. After seeing actual CSS, I remember only ever using it in my Tumblr and Neopets adventures to change image sizes, because, yeah, HTML makes those things big as hell. Otherwise, I'm just rolling with the punches and hopefully not forgetting some of these tags when I need them. Assume I am going to read that Mozilla reference page like it's holy scripture. To be honest, I've spent most of my time in the past week thinking about Riptide (Splatoon LAN tournament in Sandusky. Yes. I'm responsible for the posters. My teammate made them but I put them up) next weekend. And I still need to email you about it and I keep forgetting to and I'm sorry about that. </p>

    <a>2 whole paragraphs? You're running me dry here. Oh, I really enjoyed <a href="http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org">http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/</a>. If there is a story or message it's trying to tell me I understand none of it. But I still love it, especially the color palette. Would describing it as MS-DOS be accurate? It looks dated and it hurts my eyes. It's fantastic. When I learn how to add different colors to elements I am going to create pure eyesores.</p></div>

        <p>Guess what occupied most of my time this weekend? It was a lot of fun. We made redemption bracket (that's the bracket that determines the bottom half of the top 16. That's pretty good, considering we're low level.) I made sure to get the hypertext narrative assignment done before we went so I wouldn't have to do anything over the weekend. I forgot about this one. Oops! Luckily, I got home at about 7pm, so I'm not scrambling to write this down.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While making the not-quite-website (html journey, maybe?), I found myself wondering if there was another way to do certain things. This is especially true of the first page, where I wanted a long gap for comedic effect, so I copy-and-pasted the a break tag until I was satisfied. I don't know if there was a better way to set up the decoy page. It's possible that if there is, it might be too complicated for the scope of this class anyway. To get what appears to be the same link to lead to a different page the second time it's clicked, I just cloned the whole page and changed where the links direct. I'm also not quite sure how much content was necessary, but I'm satisfied with what I made. </p>

    <p>i am not going to lie to you css is making my head spin a little. thank god visual studio code creates a little drop-down list when you narrow down the field enough (i do not know the proper terminology.) im starting to get busier and thus the roller coaster of the average college semester begins its descent. yay! i was deeply entertained by the website i made on friday. i think choppy tile backgrounds are a perfect artifact of old internet. if you dont connect them so they're seamless they look so ugly. i kind of love it. </p>
    <br>
    <p>in my future i do see myself adding a line of code and my entire website breaks and i freak out. i think this is universal for everyone who has ever coded anything ever. it still frightens me. i find when that happens when i'm making something with my hands my attempts to fix it usually make it worse. but digital is less permanent. so we will see how it goes. still scared though. </p>

    <p>it is genuinely impressive how exhausted i am when im barely qualified as a full-time student by credit hours. i mean. maybe i should talk to student disability services but i'm not sure what i'd get out of it. meh. i don't think i really need anything right now i'm just tired all of the damn time. oh well. i liked working on the 5 variations thing. it was fun staying true to my word on the ugly eyestrain i promised. i liked seeing what i could add to make it even worse (like that vertical text someone used).</p>
    <br>
    <p>additionally, seeing how many images i use, it would probably be worth it to sort things into subfolders. perhaps i will do that. or maybe i won't because i'm the type of artist who doesn't really give a shit about getting paint all over my hands and clothes. i got a little bit of oil paint on my phone case this week. whatever. maybe the messy workspace is part of the vibe. but maybe if i want to use as many images as i did in my second and fourth variations a subfolder would probably make things a lot less messy when more pages get into the mix. i'll consider it but i can't promise i will do it.</p>

    <p>first of all, i'm really happy with how my portfolio website came out. even if it's decently simple (and not very adaptable to different screen sizes) it's effective and hits the aesthetic i'm going for. the gifs were a pain in the ass to get right and even though i wish they started playing on mouseover from the beginning instead of the show/hide slapdash solution i have going on. I don't care enough to change it though, to be honest. just gonna have to focus on the next and move ahead.</p>

    <p>javascript is extremely intimidating to me. however. i do like if/then statements. i used scratch a lot as a kid so i think i have a decent handle on how to use them and what situations. Math scary, however. Math so very scary. i think it's fun how javascript reads a bit more sentence-y than html does, especially the aforementioned if/then statements. i don't know if that'll make it easier, because it'll feel natural, or harder, because it's less straightforward. I haven't written any yet, truthfully. We'll see?</p>
